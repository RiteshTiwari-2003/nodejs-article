### what is mongo db and why it is used? ?
mongodb is nosql database , document oriented database that store data in BSON(JSON LIKE) documents.
it is :
1. schema -flexible 
2. horizontally scalable 
3. good for rapid development and handling unstructured and semi structured data .

### what is collection and what is documents?
documents: basic unit of data, stored as a json like object .
collection: a group of document , similar to table in relational db , but without a fix schema 

### what is  mongoose and why it is used with node js ?
mongoose is an odm (object data modeling) library for mongodb and node js ,
it define schema and models 
provide validaton , middleware/hooks 
makes querying easy with nice api 

example: 
const UserShema=new mongoose.Schema({
    name:String,
    email:{type::String, required:true,unique:true}
});
const User=mongoose.model("User",UserSchema);

### how do you connect a node js app to mongo db using mongoose ?
const mongoose=require("mongoose");
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI,{
    useNewUrlParser:true,
    useUnifiedTopology:true
}).then(()=>{console.log("DB Connected")}).catch(err=>{console.error(err)})

### basic crud operations with mongoose?
//create
await User.create({name:"Ritesh",email:"riteshtiwari3112003@gmail.com"});
//read
const users=await User.find();
const user=await User.findById(id);
//update
await User.findByIdAndUpdate(id,{name:"upendra"},{new:true})
//delete 
await User.findByIdAndDelete(id);

### what are indexs in mongodb ?
indexes improve query erformance by allowing mongodb to search data more efficiently 
uses extra storage 
slow down write operation slightly 
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: { type: String, unique: true, index: true }
});

### what is difference between find(), findById() and findOne()?
find(filter) return array of matching documents
findOne(filter) return the first matching document 
findById(id) find document by its _id field 
 

 #### mongo db introducton 

 homogeneous data storage refer to a system where all the data is stored in a consistent format:
 with in a single mongo db collection , the document typically share a largely homogeneous structure , while 
 mongodb's schema is flexible (document in the dsame collections dont need to have the exact same field or data types), in practice, for efficient querying and data management 
 developer usually  design 
 document within a collection to have a consistent set of field and data types

 scale : while relational database do support sharding , mongodb often highlights scalability as a key strenght for several reasons.
1. architectural difference and design philosphy: 
schema flexibility : mongodb 's schema -less or flexible schema allows for easier evolution and adaptaion of data structure without the need for complex and potentially disruptive schema migration that 
can be common in sharded relational database. this flexibility can simplify scaling efforts , espacially 
when dealing with rapidly changing data requirement

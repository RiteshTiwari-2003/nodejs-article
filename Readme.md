2.  Allow you to run javascript on your machine or servers.
3.  Built on the V8 javascript engine for speed 
4. robust ecosystem with npm 

### what is the open source?

databse (connect to databse like mongo or mysql)

## why nodejs special as a runtime ?
v8 engine:

Built in apis:
node js comes with builtin apis (like fs for file system or http for server) so you can build powerfull application without extra libraries .

### why do we need nodejs?
single language for full stack development :
developers can use javascript for both frontend and backend , reducing complexity .
for exampe , a mern stack project (mongodb , express , react, node)

high performance :
thanks to v8 engine , nodejs is super fast .
it can handle thousand of simultaneous connection with ease

event driven and non blocking i/o:
unlike traditional servers that block a thread for each requrest , nodejs uses asynchronous model , making it highly efficient for handling multiple tasks
